                            <p>
                                A pioneering Indian astrophysicist, the former head of Theoretical Physics Section at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, and 
                                currently an (Hon) Adjunct Professor at Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai.Known for his distinct views, Dr Mitra has regularly 
                                questioned the mainstream cosmological concepts such as the Big Bang, Dark Energy and Black Holes; his claims have been backed by several 
                                scientists across the globe. Scientists have come to favour his claims over resolution of the “black hole information paradox”, which was 
                                presented 13 years before Stephen Hawking. On July 25, 2006, Center for Astrophysics, Harvard, issued a Press Release mentioning his 
                                original idea.It is extremely rare in Indian Science in post-independent India, that a fundamental idea developed within India has been 
                                the topic of a press release by Harvard or any Ivy-league institute. One of the leading speakers on Theoretical Physics, Dr Mitra has also 
                                shared this honour with few Nobel Laureates; and in 2017, DST India invited him to the Nobel Laureate Symposium at the Vibrant Gujarat 
                                Festival. He is accredited with the setting up of Himalayan Gamma Ray Observatory and initiating research in Theoretical Astrophysics both 
                                in J&K and in BARC way back in the 1980s! He continues to empower aspiring astrophysicists all over India and has a book entitled "The Rise 
                                & Fall of the Black Hole Paradigm" coming out in 2018.

                                Andrea Thumshirn, the name might not be a household name in Indian hockey, but her work to develop the sport at the grassroots level is 
                                unmatched. Also a German Premier League hockey player, Andrea came to India as a tour operator and in the next 2 years, moved 
                                permanently to India to living a very basic lifestyle, in rural and remote Rajasthan. Andrea had been playing the sport ever since she 
                                was six. When she had suffered an injury, she quit playing professional hockey. So, she started coaching kids in the sport in Germany. 
                                She brought the same passion and love of the game to India, as the founder and head of Hockey Village India and also started a primary 
                                English medium school to provide better education to the kids. Hockey Village India, first started in Garh Himmat Singh village, from 
                                where she was forced to flee because the villagers were made to believe that the German lady would use her school to convert the kids 
                                into Christianity and 'westernise' them, the rumour gave ammunition and she fell victim to the politics. Despite battling suspicion, tackling bureaucratic apathy and struggling for sponsors to continue with her passion to teach hockey to the kids, sticking to her guns, Andrea relocated to a nearby village and since then she has coached 7 kids from the NGO to play in junior German league and took 5 of her students to Germany to practise in professional playgrounds and meet other players. Five of Andrea’s girls were even selected for the state team in the Under-16 category.

                            <p>
                                David began his career as a cocktail bartender, mixing drinks at some of London’s most prestigious cocktail bars, restaurants and clubs, 
                                including the London’s LAB bar as well as venues abroad before retraining as an artisan bread baker and pastry chef. Having grown up in 
                                South Africa, David took to Indian climes like a fish to water & on a visit to India in 2013 with his partner, found high-quality cocoa 
                                growing in Karnataka, which kickstarted his career as a chocolatier. David studied the alchemical healing arts, sacred geometry and 
                                music, and went on to bring those principles to his work with food when envisaging the Earth Loaf project. Currently, the co-founder,

                                Indian product — but it took a Londoner with Greek roots to make it and for David, it's simply his vision, translated through fine 
                                chocolate.

                            <p>
                                Sahej Rahal, born and brought up in the sprawling Mumbai metropolis, Rahal graduated from Rachana Sansad Academy of Fine Arts, trained 
                                in painting but branched out into other mediums of artistic expression. In early 2017, Rahal worked on art installations spread out 
                                across Liverpool city, with objects made using scrap metal and wood that he found. Followed by, exhibitions in Glasgow, Scotland, which 
                                were featured in 'The Week's Top Exhibition' in the UK. Rahal's artworks are as much science fiction and fantasy as they are weird and 
                                wonderful. Art might be his first love, but storytelling is equally integral to this 28-year-old’s practice. Working with film,

                                of many prestigious international residencies and won the Forbes Award for Debut Solo Show, 2014. Rahal continues to challenge the 
                                notions of conventional art, which makes his voice continuously important one, both in and around the spaces that define today’s art 
                                world.

Scientists have come to favour his claims over resolution of the “black hole information paradox”, which was presented 13 years before Stephen Hawking. On July 25, 2006, Center for Astrophysics, Harvard, issued a Press Release mentioning his original idea.It is extremely rare in Indian Science in post-independent India, that a fundamental idea developed within India has been the topic of a press release by Harvard or any Ivy-league institute.

Despite battling suspicion, tackling bureaucratic apathy and struggling for sponsors to continue with her passion to teach hockey to the kids, sticking to her guns, Andrea relocated to a nearby village and since then she has coached 7 kids from the NGO to play in junior German league and took 5 of her students to Germany to practise in professional playgrounds and meet other players.

Andrea had been playing the sport ever since she was six. When she had suffered an injury, she quit playing professional hockey. So, she started coaching kids in the sport in Germany. She brought the same passion and love of the game to India, as the founder and head of Hockey Village India and also started a primary English medium school to provide better education to the kids. Hockey Village India, first started in Garh Himmat Singh village, from where she was forced to flee because the villagers were made to believe that the German lady would use her school to convert the kids into Christianity and 'westernise' them, the rumour gave ammunition and she fell victim to the politics. Despite battling suspicion, tackling bureaucratic apathy and struggling for sponsors to continue with her passion to teach hockey to the kids, sticking to her guns, Andrea relocated to a nearby village and since then she has coached 7 kids from the NGO to play in junior German league and took 5 of her students to Germany to practise in professional playgrounds and meet other players.
